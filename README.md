## A .NET library for fuzzy matching of structured data records

This library is mostly focused on fuzzy matching of demographic data. I plan to bring together 20+ different algorithms for fuzzy matching text strings, and convert as many of them as possible into a standard format, Fraction. (long Numerator and long Denominator. Or in other words, Rational Number.)

Then I can, theoretically, create a meta program that compares the results vs. performance of each algorithm over time, as applied to demographic data, and end up settling on one or two to use over the others.

Contributions welcome. More details to follow.
